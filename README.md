# python-api-challenge
In this challenge, I used the OpenWeather APT and Geoapify to analyze weather data and answer the fundamental question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

In WeatherPy, I used the data retrieved from the APIs and I created several plots to show the following relationships:

- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

For each of those relationships, I computed the linear relationship separating the data into the Northern and Southern hemispheres. 

In VacationPy, I used Geoapify APT and geoViews Python library to create map visualizations. 

The first plot makes a point for every city that is shown in the data frame and bases the points size on the city's humidity. In the second plot, I found hotels across the world that fit certain weather criteria that I prefer.
